Data source: All data was readily available for use through the website "Kaggle".
Data description: data1 is a list of meteoritic reviews for 1000+games, as well as its user score and platform.
data2 lists off the total sales for each game, cataloging several hundred games. The data may be outdated, however.
data3 contains information akin to that of data2, but it seems to be more comprehensive and recent.
Project overview:
In this project, we aim to find the correlation between a game's reception and its sales. Our hypothesis is that the better a game is reviewed, the more sales it would have.
